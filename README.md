# Matlab-Work
This repository contains MATLAB files that I can refer to when computing data for laboratory expirements performed in my chemistry classes.

Most of these files contain both live and simple scripts depending on the situation presented. Either way, they are important to my data analysis for results acquired in the laboratory.
