% Checks wether or not the value of Keq is greater than or less than 1

%If the value of Keq is greater than 1, then we know that the reaction
%favors the products

%If the value of Keq is less \than 1, then we know that the reaction favors
%the reactants

%If the value of Kew is equal to 1, then we know that the reaction is truly
% in equilibrium
